ros-kinetic-khi-robot-control (1.1.0-0xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * robot_control: fix msg deps of main. (#9 <https://github.com/Kawasaki-Robotics/khi_robot/issues/9>)
    Seems to have been remove in #6 <https://github.com/Kawasaki-Robotics/khi_robot/issues/6>.
  * update travis.yml (#6 <https://github.com/Kawasaki-Robotics/khi_robot/issues/6>)
    * update travis.yml
    * rs_desc: add missing install targets.
    * duaro_desc: add missing install targets.
    * rs_gazebo: add missing install targets.
    * duaro_gazebo: add missing install targets.
    * description: pkgs do not run depend on urdf.
    * duaro_desc: add roslaunch testing.
    Tries to load xacro as parameter.
    * rs_desc: add roslaunch testing.
    Tries to load xacros as parameters.
    * robot_control: use imported target for KRNX binary blob.
    Avoid setting link directories.
    * robot_control: warn user if CPU arch could not be detected.
    * robot_control: remove redundant dep declaration.
    'khi_robot_msgs' is already a build_depend and is another package, so build ordering will already take the dependencies into account.
    * robot_control: don't install headers.
    The main library is not exported (by catkin_package(..)), so the headers also don't need to be installed.
    This also resolves an installation issue: the install(..) statement expects a sub dir called 'khi_robot_control' in the 'include' directory, but that doesn't exist.
    * robot_control: sort components alphabetically.
    Make catkin_lint happ(ier).
    * robot_control: fix realtime_tools unconfigured build dep.
    * robot_control: sort source files for robot_client target.
    Make catkin_lint happ(ier).
    * moveit_cfgs: install scripts dir.
    * rs080n_moveit_config does not have script directory
    * set indigo as allow_failures
    * add test for khi_robot_control/main and libkrnx
    * robot_control: work-around for KRNX lib blob linking issues.
    Based on suggestion from @k-okada.
    Not sure whether this is an actual proper solution, or just a work-around.
    Systems with stricter ld library path security might not like this.
  * Updates to build scripts and manifests (packaging) (#5 <https://github.com/Kawasaki-Robotics/khi_robot/issues/5>)
